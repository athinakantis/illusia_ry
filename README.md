## Workflow Standards

### Before making a PR

1. <ins>**Please check that you are making a PR into the right branch**</ins>.  
   Are you merging into DEV or main?

2. Do not add test functions/data to DEV. Keep it on a separate branch for yourself.
   This clutters the code and makes it more confusing for your teammates and takes time to clean up.  
   Actual tests are fine
